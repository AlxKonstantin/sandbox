# Hi!

I work on Java, spend time on math, basketball and tango. The resources below can show you a little my code style:

- [microservice](oftest) tracking users and solving inverse geodesy problem
- my comparation of [SCRUM vs. KANBAN](symbiomark/README.md#scrum-vs-kanban) in russian
- partial implementation of [pure client](../../../vazhno-api) for external JSON API
- [HTML grabber](../../../slone/tree/master/extractor) retrieving and parsing game model from online game creator

If you want to see me bragging about myself, look at [my CV].See my [CV](https://linkedin.com/in/antivoland/en).
